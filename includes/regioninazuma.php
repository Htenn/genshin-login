            Inazuma (/ˌinəˈz(j)uːmə/) (Japanese: 稲妻 Inazuma) is one of the seven regions in Teyvat. It is an archipelagic region that worships the Raiden Shogun, the Electro Archon, who is also the leader of its governing body, the Inazuma Shogunate. Inazuma is located approximately 4 km southeast from Liyue Harbor and is a close neighbor with the Dark Sea.

            In the past year relative to the current events of the game, the situation in Inazuma has made a drastic turn towards isolationism, locked down under the Sakoku Decree. "Baal" also enacted the related Vision Hunt Decree, declaring that Visions, as gifts from the to inlay them in the hands of a statue of the Thousand-Armed, Hundred-Eyed God.

            Atsuko, an Inazuman who defected to Liyue, describes the country as having a "tense" and "dangerous" environment and discourages traveling there; she also remarks that the Kanjobugyo, one of the Tri-Commission, conduct many assessments that citizens must pass in own raft and fleeing to Liyue. However, the Fatui seem to be able to freely enter and exit due to their diplomatic immunity.

            An Isolated Archipelago Far East of Teyvat Overcome endless thunderstorms and set foot on the islands of red maple and cherry blossoms. On winding shores and towering cliffs, and in forests and mountains full of secrets, witness the Eternity pursued by Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho.
