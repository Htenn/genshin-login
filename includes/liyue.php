                Beidou is the leader of The Crux — an armed crew based in Liyue Harbor.
                <br><br>
                Beidou is a trusted leader, so much so that her crew believe her capable of taming the storms and billows on the sea.
                <br><br>
                "It's Beidou! Even the mightiest of storms must bow its head to her might!"

                As the secretary of Yuehai Pavilion, Ganyu undertakes many tasks that ordinary folk do not see.
                <br><br>
                For those that have witnessed her standing by the dock at daybreak, enjoying her breakfast in silence, it is difficult to imagine her in such a post.
                <br><br>
                Even still, by the time the sun has fully risen, she will have returned to Yuehai Pavilion overlooking Yujing Terrace, to continue to fulfill her contract.

                The 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a young lady managing the parlor's operations. Despite her position, she's an amiable person who puts on no airs.
                <br><br>
                Her antics are as plentiful as the sand on Yaoguang Shoal. She never ceases to shock people with her countless bizarre ideas.
                <br><br>
                Hu Tao may seem like all play and no work, spending every free moment on leisure and being widely considered a laissez-faire business owner.

                Her radical actions have seen stellar results, but they have also attracted murmurings of opprobrium among those devoted to Rex Lapis.
                <br><br>
                As Keqing sees it, such opposition are the excuses of those who have grown complacent under the aegis of their deity, and who cannot consider the future of humanity of their own accord.
                <br><br>
                But someone must walk on the front line of the epoch and create a new path with their own hands — and the Yuheng star is determined to do her part in this endeavor.
