            Mondstadt (German: Mondstadt "Moon City") is one of the seven regions in Teyvat, and the first in which the Traveler
            starts to look for their lost sibling. It is the city-state that worships Barbatos, the Anemo Archon.
            <br><br>
            Ever since the beginning, Mondstadt has celebrated a festival called the Ludi Harpastum every year, with 15 days of
            games for the children to enjoy.

            A city of freedom that lies in the northeast of Teyvat. From amongst mountains and wide-open plains, carefree breezes carry the scent of dandelions — a gift from the Anemo God, Barbatos — across Cider Lake to Mondstadt, which sits on an island in the middle of the lake.

                        Mondstadt considers its trademarks the Dandelion, Flight and Wine, being the very few things that Mondstadt learned from the Wind Archon to build Mondstadt.

                        Roses in Mondstadt, instead of love, represent the saying "As wine bottles are corked, so too are my lips sealed." It encourages people to keep one another's secrets.

                    <li>
                        Citizens and people in Liyue often mock Mondstadt for being a city without rule with their god abandoned, showcasing the contrast between how others view freedom versus constitution. They are also unaware of the reasons as to why the Anemo Archon decided not to rule over Mondstadt, which may hint that every other region shares the same outlook.

                        In the trailer Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail, under the title of the quest The Outlander Who Caught the Wind, there is a line written in Teyvat's Latin script. It reads "Mea libertas meus canor" which translates to "My freedom is my song."

                        Many characters wear gloves that have a different color on the palm compared to the back. This could be because the palm-side is made from a different material which provides better grip. It appears to be a fashion unique to Mondstadt.

                        Mondstadt is the only region whose capital lack background NPC's.
