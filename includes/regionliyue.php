            A bountiful harbor that lies in the east of Teyvat. Mountains stand tall and proud alongside the stone forest, that, together with the open plains and lively rivers, make up Liyue's bountiful landscape, which shows its unique beauty through each of the four seasons. Just how many gifts from the Geo God lie in wait amongst the rocks of Liyue's mountains?

                        In the trailer Teyvat Chapter Storyline Preview: Travail, under the title of the quest Farewell, Archaic Lord, there is a line written in Teyvat's Latin script. It reads "Ruat caelum fiat pactum," which roughly means "Let the contract be made, though the heavens fall," and is modified from the phrase fiat justitia ruat caelum.

                        Liyue is inspired by China.

                        Liyue Harbor is said to be an economical center, similar to many port cities in China.

                    <li>
                        Morax, the founder of Liyue, quotes some proverbs from the Analects of Confucius in a (non-canon) official blog post.

                        Divine Body from Guyun says a variety of different ideals were born and died during the Archon War, where Liyue survived the war. It may be a reference to the Hundred Schools of Thought during the Warring States period of Ancient China, where the Confucian philosophy of "Liyue" (Rites and Music) survived the war in academia.
