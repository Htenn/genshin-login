                Amber is an Outrider of the Knights of Favonius. In an age where Outriders are becoming obsolete, she continues on with
                her responsibilities.

                Whether it's before the Good Hunter's signboard, the banks of Cider Lake, or the tree tops at Windrise, one can find

                Klee is well known for the danger she presents. As an official member of the Knights of Favonius, her strength in combat
                cannot be underestimated.
                <br><br>
                As a hyperactive child, meanwhile, her destructive capabilities cannot be overstated.
                <br><br>
                After all, while other Mondstadt children her age are still playing with regular toys, Klee's favorite toys are... live
                explosives.
